# VaultLib
VaultLib is a fast, open-source and powerful library for processing databases created with Electronic Arts' **AttribSys** framework.

> NOTE: Full documentation and a fully cleaned-up API are in progress.

## Motivation
A number of factors played a part in the decision to create this library:

- The existence of solely closed source tools as opposed to open source ones
- Lack of a robust framework that can be extended and tweaked
- Necessity for a framework to support custom tools and processes
- A great desire to learn

## Key features

- High performance in both loading and saving
- Full support for all major parts of the AttribSys framework
- Support for 64-bit and big-endian data streams
